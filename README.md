Hello to All

My name is Marco. I'm looking to get into programming and brush up on my english while doing so.
At the moment i'm working as an electrician and in 2019 started a 3 year school to become a technician.
Part of the classes is focused on programming in C++, SQL, HTML and CSS, so i want to get some practice.
Starting 2021 i'll start applying for jobs as software developer.

Thats all for now, thanks for your time.
